           <h2> Our Story</h2>
              <section> Once upon a time, there was a girl in a far off land. She lived in a land of riches but her senses were off. Her sight was so bad that the great big trees she spent her time daydreaming about appeared to her as menacing giants. Her sense of smell had also been corrupted so even the sickeningly sweet aroma of her favorite treats smelled rancid. She dreamed of being anyone but herself to escape the conditions of her personal prison, everyday she rose to the sight of hulking giants and stomach swirling stenches; while envisioning lush greenery and the fragrance of fresh flowers. Until one day she awoke to the most amazing smell and when she opened her eyes, she realized her vision was clear for the first time in her life. Those figures she feared were actually the very thing of her dreams. 

              Rich Aesthetics was conceived from the lessons that I’ve learned in being vulnerable and having a willingness to shift perspectives. I’ve gained more clarity about myself and my path throughout the “roughest” times of my life. Rich Aesthetics was born into the world with the intention to be a beauty brand and though beauty will always be an outcome, the goal has shifted to holding space for my own and other’s expansion. 

              I’ve found that self esteem and confidence are the cornerstones for success. When either of those areas experience lack, it becomes difficult to thrive in other aspects of life. I, personally, found it hard to build in those areas without the support of self– physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. In our society, it’s very easy to feel stuck in life when often the answers we look for lie in sitting still and standing firm in our faith. When self-doubt and other downers that can lead to anxiety and depression creep-in, it’s a process to get out of; a process I believe requires community but above all support from self. Rich Aesthetics LLC is focused on encouraging your exploration into your desires and helping you wake up to the life you want to live, as well as the version of yourself you see living it. Above all, I aim for everyone that comes in contact with Rich Aesthetics to be renewed in their faith in themselves and to be reinvigorated by the comfort and joy of their true self-expression.

           <h2> Our Mission</h2>
                <section >
                  Rich Aesthetics is a brand born with the intention to build community through the sphere of beauty, self expression and exploration. 
                  It’s a creative hub centered on community inclusion and support. Rich Aesthetics is less about how you’re physically perceived and more about positive energetic contributions. 
                  More than a look, it’s a lifestyle.

                  A lot of people advocate for luxury aesthetics as defined by looking your best, without addressing the same level of advocacy and support when many times the issue is deeper than looks. The mission through Rich Aesthetics LLC is to curate a judgment-free experience of beauty maintenance and establish a setting where community thrives. We’ve all heard the saying “it takes a village to raise a child” yet rarely has the conversation emphasized the need for community to maintain the village or the fact that our communities are becoming more and more exclusive. Rich Aesthetics is centered on community and the ways in which we can improve all of our quality of life by helping one another.At Rich Aesthetics, our mission is to empower individuals to embrace their unique beauty through exceptional hair care. We believe that hair is more than just strands; it's an expression of identity and confidence. Our commitment is to provide you with the knowledge, products, and inspiration needed to achieve your hair care goals. We are dedicated to delivering top-quality, expert-recommended  solutions tailored to your specific needs.We are driven by innovation, integrity, and inclusivity. .

  Join us at Rich Aesthetics and embark on a journey that celebrates individuality, fosters self-confidence, and helps you look and feel your very best.
